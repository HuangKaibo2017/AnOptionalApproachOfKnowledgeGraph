# An Optional Approach Of Knowledge Graph (KG) Real-world Practicing

## Why am I doing this?
I am honored with some studying groups on KG real-world pracicing. They, talents of the group, select domain/sector/goal/feature.
I go with my long years exp on team organizing, project managing and tricks of problem-solving, specially on tech.
Also, I would put my answers of group question, tricks, exp in this open source project in case, someone else might found useful to them. :)

## How it would be organzed or proceeded?
I will try to make a book-like structure of it. And more ofternly, I will put answers in a folder and links them to the structure later. 
So it would alway an alpha<-->beta stuff. Hope it would be too confusing. :P

## All kinds help would be appreciated!
I can't finish it by myself. Questions, problems, reviews, critics, pull-requests, and other helps are all welcome.
